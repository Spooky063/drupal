# Add color scheme on theme Drupal

> ⚠️ Deprecated in version 10

## Introduction

For adding a color scheme on custom theme, you need to add some additional files 
to your custom theme for enable feature on `Appareance` theme tabs.

## How to?

Take for example a custom theme called `theme`. 
You need a new directory named `color`, a css file for skeleton of your color 
scheme and alter theme.libraries.yml.

## Important to know

In your css file, your hex color must not be uppercase. Otherwise it won't work.
